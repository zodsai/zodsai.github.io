Zodsai (Thai: สดใส) is a project I started in 2011 with a goal to enhance learning by generating and review knowledge and open it to the public. The idea was preliminary introduced in Juniata College's Liberal Arts Symposium in 2014 ([Watch the presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkc-QgTGR8Y)). Now, the site is being overhauled with Jekyll, a static site generator. It is now being hosted on GitHub and Cloudflare.
